        <h3>How to make ice</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Its pretty hard, get some water and put it in the freezer.  Hopefully, you know how to get water (the faucet) and you have a freezer. <br>
            Be sure not to put your water in a sealed container, or you might break it.  Remember, <em>it takes time for the water to freeze</em> so be patient.
        </p>
